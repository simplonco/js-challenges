The exercises are ordered roughly in order of difficulty, but it's a bit
haphazard.

## How to run tests locally?

```shell
# Install jasmine:
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
$ sudo npm install -g jasmine-node

# Go inside your project folder and:
$ jasmine-node *.spec.js --verbose --captureExceptions
```
